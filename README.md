## 🧠 **VendingPLUS Database System**

A relational database project developed in **Oracle** for managing vending machines, stock, warehouses, and logistics operations.  
The system supports product management, stock monitoring, refilling routes, and operational analytics.  

---

## 🚀 **Setup / Execution**

1. Open the project in **Oracle SQL Developer** (or another Oracle client).
2. Run the script `Script_CreateTables.sql` to create the database structure.
3. Execute `Script_InsertData.sql` to populate the database with base and test data.
4. Run the PL/SQL files located in `phase-3_final/` to create **functions, procedures, and triggers.**

After these steps, the database is ready to execute analytical queries, views, and operational logic.
